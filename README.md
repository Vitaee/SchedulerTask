# SchedulerTask
A load balancing task scheduler Assume there is a computational environment where a lot of computational resources are available, but they are also shared across multiple projects.

## Steps for development environment.
First off all in my system i already have python version 3.10. I used ```pyenv``` to change my python version to ```3.9.7``` which mentioned in task description.
- Simply install pyenv with this command: ```curl https://pyenv.run | bash```.
- Then install python version you want: ```pyenv install 3.9.7```.
- Then enable it on your system globally: ```pyenv global 3.9.7```.
- Install dependencies with this command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
- Then run main.py: ```python main.py```. Run tests with ```pytest``.

## My development system.
Exact python version: ```Python 3.9.7 (default, Mar  3 2023, 18:31:50) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux```
Ubuntu system info:  ```Linux hq10509d 5.15.0-60-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 20 14:29:49 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux```
